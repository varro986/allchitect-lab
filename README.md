# Allchitect Lab

Welcome to the **Allchitect Lab**. This is my technical sandbox—the space where theory meets hands-on experimentation.

## Vision
This repository serves as the technical extension of my Substack, [Allchitect](https://allchitect.substack.com/). 
Here, I host code snippets, examples or whatever.
